## 4. Ticket Creation and Categorization

### Step 1: Create Sample Tickets

Created 20–25 simulated IT issues including:

- Printer not working
- Outlook not syncing
- Password reset request
- Slow system performance
- Network connectivity issue
- Software installation request
- VPN not connecting
- Shared folder access denied

### Ticket Information Included

Each ticket contained:

- Requester Name
- Department
- Issue Description
- Category
- Priority
- Assigned Agent

---

## 5. Priority Configuration

Freshdesk supports four priority levels:

| Priority | Impact Level | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Low | Minor issue | Software installation |
| Medium | Affects single user | Outlook issue |
| High | Affects department | Network failure |
| Urgent | Business critical | Server outage |

### Screenshot Included
- Priority Field Configuration

### Purpose of Priority Field

- Enables ticket escalation
- Helps SLA tracking
- Ensures faster resolution of critical incidents

---

## 6. SLA Management

Configured SLA rules as follows:

- Urgent → 1 Hour Response Time
- High → 4 Hours Response Time
- Medium → 8 Hours Response Time
- Low → 24 Hours Response Time

Tickets were resolved according to configured SLA timelines.

## 7. Ticket Assignment Workflow

### Ticket Lifecycle Process

1. Ticket Created
2. Priority Assigned
3. Category Selected
4. Assigned to IT Support Agent
5. Investigation and Troubleshooting
6. Resolution Provided
7. Ticket Closed
8. Resolution Documented
